# twitterClone

twitterClone is a project inspired by twitter.com.
twitterClone allows a user to create an account and post messages to a feed that every user can see.
Users can follow other users, and gain access to a new feed based on who the user follows and what posts they like.
Liking posts will show up in the users' portfolio along with the posts the user has made.
Users have the ability to update an avatar picture and background picture that is displayed on their profile.

## Planned Updates

1. Delete posts/comments/replies
2. Ability to attach and display image files with posts
3. Searchable #trending hashtag
4. The ability to @ users
